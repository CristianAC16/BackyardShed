<h1>Backyard Shed</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Designing and building a 10ft x 16ft backyard shed, including the demolition of two 10ft x 10ft sheds. 
The new shed will serve as a versatile workspace for storage and small-scale tasks, featuring built-in shelving, a workbench, and electrical outlets. 
It will be constructed with durable materials, ensuring long-term stability and security. 
The focus is on creating a functional and organized space, while maintaining safety, ventilation, and efficiency.
<br />
These 5 steps were considered:

1.  Material Selection: <br /> Identifying the appropriate steel grade for the gears, shafts and key, with sufficient mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength, hardness, and fatigue resistance).

2.  Gear Design: <br /> Spur gears involve selecting the number of teeth, pitch diameter, and gear ratio. The gears must be designed to handle the required torque and power while considering factors such as pressure angle (20°), diametral pitch (6), and reliability (99%). The gearbox must also meet a design life of 14,000 hours.

3.  Shaft Design: <br /> Shaft 1 (pinion) and shaft 2 (gear) must be designed with adequate diameters, supported by bearings at locations A, B, C & D. Both shafts should be sized to handle the loads based on shear, bending moments, and torque diagrams. A factor of safety ≥ 2.5 for static design and ≥ 1.5 for fatigue design must be ensured, and endurance limits for fatigue calculations should be considered.

4.  Bearings Selection: <br /> Bearings must be selected to match the shaft dimensions and rotational speeds, ensuring smooth operation while withstanding the load.

5.  Safety Factors and Durability: <br /> The factor of safety of ≥ 2 for shaft diameters at critical points is required, and all components must be designed for a 99% reliability factor.
